# Project setup
A user will be able to input values and get to know whether they can form a triangle or not.
# BDD
If a user enters a value that is not a number, the app will inform them that it is not a number.

If a user enters three similar values, it will indicate that an Equilateral triangle can be formed.

If a user enters two similar values that are different from the other, it indicates that it is an Isosceles triangle.

If a user enters three different values, it indicates that it will form a Scalene triangle.

Any other entry will indicate that it will not form a triangle.
